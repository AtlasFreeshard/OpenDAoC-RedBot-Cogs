# OpenDAoC x RedBot Cogs

These are the custom developed cogs we use on our instance of [RedBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot) on the [OpenDAoC Official Discord](https://discord.gg/RHqzyt8KyC)

All cogs are designed to be added to your own RedBot instance to manage or access the API of your OpenDAoC instance.  
The default cog configuration will display data from the official hosted OpenDAoC servers.
